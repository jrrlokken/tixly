- Microservice app using an SSR React and Next JS app for the frontend.
- Each service is created using Node and Express.
- Data for each service is held in either a Mongo database or Redis.
- The entire app is deployed and runs in Docker containers executed in a Kubernetes cluster.
- Almost all of the code is written with Typescript.

This architecture is easily scalable and the application is production-ready.
